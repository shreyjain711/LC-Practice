### ***[Find Minimum In Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)***:
- ***Problem Desc***: array has only unique values, rotated ```1..n``` times
- ***Binary search[O(logn) time | O(1) space]***: compare mid,hi -> lo,mid can be same when size 2; mid,hi same only when all 3 same -> loop would've ended already
  ```cpp
  int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
      int lo = 0, hi = nums.size()-1, mid;
      while (lo<hi) {
          mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
          // comp mid,hi -> they can't be same -> lo,mid can be or all 3 same (won't loop)
          if (nums[mid] > nums[hi]) lo = mid+1; 
          else hi = mid;
      } return nums[lo];
  }
  ```

### ***[Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock With Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)***:
- ***Problem Desc***: given prices of stocks for day 0..n-1, tell max profit possible at the end given after selling we have to wait 1 day before next buy
- ***at any point, calc the max possible if we buy (i.e. either prevBuy or cooling+p[i]), cool(i.e. prevCool or prevSell), sell (currMaxBuy+p[i]) [O(n) time | O(1) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int buy=INT_MIN, sold=0, cooling=0;
      for (int p: prices) {
          buy = max(cooling-p, buy);
          cooling = max(cooling, sold);
          sold = buy+p;
      } return max(sold, cooling);
  }
  ```
