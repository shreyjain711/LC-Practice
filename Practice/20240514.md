### **[Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/):** given arr, find longest consecutive seq possible (i.e. if arr was sorted)
- ***Problem Desc***: in O(n) time, for an unsorted array, tell what would be the longest consec seq if it was sorted
- ***make hashset of arr; iterate on hashset, if currElem start of a seq (i.e. prev elem not in set) find curr seq len and keep iterating [O(n) time | O(n) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
      unordered_set<int> hashset(nums.begin(), nums.end());
      int lcs = 0;
      for (auto n: hashset) {
          if (hashset.find(n-1)==hashset.end()) {
              int nextNum = n+1, currLcs = 1;
              while (hashset.find(nextNum++)!=hashset.end()) currLcs++;
              lcs = max(lcs, currLcs);
          }
      } return lcs;
  }
  ```

### ***[Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock With Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)***:
- ***Problem Desc***: given prices of stocks for day 0..n-1, tell max profit possible at the end given after selling we have to wait 1 day before next buy
- ***At each price, either buy (i.e. max prev buy state or maxPrevCool-currP) OR CD (i.e. prevCD or prevS) OR Sell (i.e. buy+currP) [O(n) time | O(1) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int buy=INT_MIN, sell=0, cooldown=0;
      for (auto p: prices) {
          buy = max(buy, cooldown-p);
          cooldown = max(cooldown, sell);
          sell = buy+p;
      } return max(sell, cooldown);
  }
  ```
