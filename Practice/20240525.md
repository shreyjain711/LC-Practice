### [Non Overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/):
- ***Problem Desc***: given a list with unsorted intervals that could be overlapping, find min count of intervals to be removed to get it non overlapping
- ***Greedy, sort then if an interval begins before prev ends then count++ and curr's end will be min of prev and curr aptly removing the right inter [O(n.logn) time | O(1) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int eraseOverlapIntervals(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
      sort(begin(intervals), end(intervals));
      int count=0, currEnd=intervals[0][1];
      for (int i=1; i<intervals.size(); i++) {
          if (intervals[i][0] < currEnd) {count++; b = min(intervals[i][1], b);}
          else b = intervals[i][1];
      } return count;
  }
  ```
