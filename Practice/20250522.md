### ***[Find Minimum In Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)***:
- ***Problem Desc***: array has only unique values, rotated ```1..n``` times
- ***Brute [O(n) time | O(1) space]***: search linearly
- ***Binary search [O(logn) time | O(1) space]***: if right side ain't sorted then lo goes ahead of mid, else hi comes to mid
  ```cpp
  int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
      int lo=0, hi=nums.size()-1, mid;
      while (lo<hi) {
          mid = (lo+hi)/2;
          if (nums[mid] > nums[hi]) lo = mid+1;
          else hi = mid;
      } return nums[hi];
  }
  ```

### ***[Best Time to Buy And Sell Stock With Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/)***:
- ***Problem Desc***: given prices of stocks for day 0..n-1, tell max profit possible at the end given after selling we have to wait 1 day before next buy
- ***Brute [O(2<sup>n</sup>) time | O(n) space]***: backtracking, if on cool down then can buy or stay on cooldown, if sold then can sell buy or stay in cooldown, if bought then can sell or hold
- ***1D DP, buy = max(buy or cool-curr_p), cool = max(cool or sell), sell = buy+curr_p [O(n) time | O(n) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
      int b = INT_MIN, s = INT_MIN, c = 0;
      for (auto p: prices) {
          b = max(b, c - p);
          c = max(c, s);
          s = b+p;
      } return max(c, s);
  }
  ```
