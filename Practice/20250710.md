### **[Container with Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)**: bars of diff heights give, find biggest container they can make
- ***Problem Desc***: each pos has a wall, using two walls from the whole array, what's the greatest volume container that can be formed
- ***Start with 0 and n-1, check container, move the pointer that's smaller [O(n) time | O(1) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
      int l=0, r=height.size()-1, ans=0;
      while (l<r) {
          ans = max(ans, (r-l)*min(height[l], height[r]));
          if (height[l]<height[r]) l++;
          else r--;
      } return ans;
  }
  ```

### **[Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/):** given arr, find longest consecutive seq possible (i.e. if arr was sorted)
- ***Problem Desc***: in O(n) time, for an unsorted array, tell what would be the longest consec seq if it was sorted
- ***hashset, go across arr, if elem is start of a sequence, check seq from it, remove elems too [O(n) time | O(n) space]***:
  ```cpp
  int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
      unordered_set<int> hash(begin(nums), end(nums));
      int lc = 0, currLc = 0;
      for (auto n: nums) {
          if (!hash.count(n-1)) {
              currLc = 1; 
              while (hash.count(n+1)) {hash.erase(n++); currLc++;}
          } lc = max(lc, currLc);
      } return lc;
  }
  ```
